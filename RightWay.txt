1. Check SSH Key: Ensure that you have an SSH key set up and associated with your GitHub account.

You can check if you have an SSH key by running the following command:

cmd: ls -al ~/.ssh

If you don't have an SSH key, you can generate one using the following command:

cmd: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Note: Follow the prompts to create the key. Make sure to use the email associated with your GitHub account.


2. Add SSH Key to SSH Agent: If you have an SSH key, add it to your SSH agent so that it can be used for authentication:

cmd: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Note: Replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the path to your SSH private key if it's located in a different location.

3. Add SSH Key to GitHub Account: Copy the contents of your public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to your GitHub account. You can do this by going to your GitHub account settings, then "SSH and GPG keys," and adding your public key.

cmd: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

4. Use SSH URL: When cloning the repository, make sure to use the SSH URL (not the HTTPS URL) if you're using SSH keys for authentication:
git clone from SSH in github.com.

5. Verify Permissions: Ensure that your GitHub account has the necessary permissions to access the repository you're trying to clone. If it's a private repository, make sure you're added as a collaborator or have the required access.
